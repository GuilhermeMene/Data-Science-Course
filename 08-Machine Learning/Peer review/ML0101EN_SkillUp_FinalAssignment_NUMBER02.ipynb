    "To create a Jupyter Notebook that meets the requirements of your final project, you will need to follow a structured approach. Below are the steps and Python packages you can use for each part of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Splitting the dataset into training and testing data for regression (3 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building and training a model using Linear Regression and calculating evaluation metrics (8 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.\n",
    "   - For evaluation metrics, use `mean_squared_error`, `mean_absolute_error`, and `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating a final regression report/table of evaluation metrics (3 marks)**:\n",
    "   - You can use `pandas` to create a DataFrame to display the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building and training a model using KNN and calculating evaluation metrics (8 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `KNeighborsRegressor` from `sklearn.neighbors`.\n",
    "   - Again, use the same evaluation metrics as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Building and training a model using Decision Trees and calculating evaluation metrics (8 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `sklearn.tree`.\n",
    "   - Use the same evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Building and training a model using Logistic Regression and calculating evaluation metrics (9 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.\n",
    "   - For evaluation metrics, you can use `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, and `f1_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Building and training a model using SVM and calculating evaluation metrics (8 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `SVC` from `sklearn.svm`.\n",
    "   - Use the same classification metrics as for Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Creating a final classification report/table of evaluation metrics (3 marks)**:\n",
    "   - Use `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics` to generate a report.\n",
    "\n",
